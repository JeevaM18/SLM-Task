# SLM-Task

# Multilingual Sentiment Classification

This project implements a multilingual sentiment classification system using transformer-based models from Hugging Face. It is designed to classify textual reviews into three sentiment categories: **positive**, **neutral**, and **negative**, supporting multiple languages.

---

##  Objective

Develop a **robust NLP pipeline** for multilingual sentiment classification using `transformers`, `datasets`, and PyTorch, while ensuring:

- Clear and maintainable code structure
- Reproducibility
- Visual, metric-based evaluation
- Clean packaging for real-world usage or extension

---

## 🧠 Model Summary

- **Base Model:** `bert-base-multilingual-cased` (or `xlm-roberta-base`)
- **Architecture:** Transformer encoder with classification head
- **Task:** Text classification (`num_labels = 3`)
- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy
- **Optimizer:** AdamW with weight decay
- **Scheduler:** Linear warmup and decay

🎯 Design Philosophy
This project demonstrates:

✅ Sound technical foundations: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, clean modular design.
✅ Maintainability: Each file has a single responsibility, following industry conventions.
✅ Resourcefulness: Combines Hugging Face datasets, Trainer, and visual evaluation tools.
✅ Design trade-offs: Lightweight BERT models were preferred over heavier multilingual models to balance performance and training time.

💡 Future Enhancements
Experiment with distilled models for speed (e.g., distilbert-multilingual)

Use hyperparameter search with Optuna

Add Explainable AI modules (e.g., LIME, SHAP)

Deploy as a Streamlit or FastAPI app
